# My PhD in a Nutshell

In my PhD research, my main dissertation projects were focused on
Europe, specifically on the study of immigrants’ cultural integration;
emigrants’ family ties; and older people use of information and
communication technologies to maintain friendships. For my projects, I
relied on analyzing data retrieved using Facebook and Twitter
Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), through statistical methods
together with natural language processing. Besides this, I also
contributed to a major project in which behavioral data was surveyed via
Facebook.

## PhD Projects

### Older People and Facebook

For my first two dissertation articles, I used data retrieved from
Facebook to study older people’s use of social network sites and how
this is associated with the likelihood of having close friends. To do
so, first, I gathered the data using the Facebook API to build an index
of the differential usage of Facebook by age
[Article](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/3263). Then,
I studied the structure of the data in order to determine the best
statistical models to analyze the daily active users, and to compare
them against survey data
[Article](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11113-021-09682-3).
You can learn more about this project in the interview I did for MPIDR

### Immigrants and Language Acquisition

For my third dissertation article, I used data from Twitter to study
migrants’ language integration. To do so, I processed terabytes of
Twitter-data stored in the Internet Archive and complemented it by
retrieving some data using the Twitter API. To analyze migrants’
language acquisition, I automatized the analysis of users’ tweets in
order to categorized them as migrants and to track the language they
used in a longitudinal manner. For this, I relied on natural language
processing and on survival analysis [Working
Paper](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/bs4hk/).

### Twitter and Family Ties

This is work in progress, for which soon I will share more.

### Non-Dissertation Projects

As an expert on the use of the Facebook API, I was invited to contribute
to a major project in which behavioral data was surveyed via Facebook.
Here is all the information related with this project: [The COVID-19
Health Behavior
Survey](https://www.demogr.mpg.de/en/research_6120/digital_and_computational_demography_5555/social_and_environmental_dynamics_6603/the_covid_19_health_behavior_survey_9829/details).
