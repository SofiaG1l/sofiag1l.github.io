In my PhD research, my main dissertation projects were focused on Europe, specifically on the study of immigrants’ cultural integration; emigrants’ family ties; and older people use of information and communication technologies to maintain friendships. For my projects, I relied on analyzing data retrieved using Facebook and Twitter Application Programming Interfaces [APIs], through statistical methods together with natural language processing. Besides this, I also contributed to a major project in which behavioral data was surveyed via Facebook.


## Older People and Facebook

For my first two dissertation articles, I used data retrieved from Facebook to study older people’s use of social network sites and how this is associated with the likelihood of having close friends. To do so, first, I gathered the data using the Facebook API to build an index of the differential usage of Facebook by age [Article](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/3263). Then, I studied the structure of the data in order to determine the best statistical models to analyze the daily active users, and to compare them against survey data [Article](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11113-021-09682-3). You can learn more about this project in the interview I did for MPIDR [link](https://www.demogr.mpg.de/en/news_events_6123/news_press_releases_4630/news/do_migrants_over_50_use_social_media_to_maintain_friendships_9858).

## Immigrants and Language Acquisition

For my third dissertation article, I used data from Twitter to study migrants’ language integration. To do so, I processed terabytes of Twitter-data stored in the Internet Archive and complemented it by retrieving some data using the Twitter API. To analyze migrants’ language acquisition, I automatized the analysis of users’ tweets in order to categorized them as migrants and to track the language they used in a longitudinal manner. For this, I relied on natural language processing and on survival analysis [Working Paper](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/bs4hk/). 

## Twitter and Family Ties

This is work in progress, for which soon I will share more.


## Non-Dissertation Projects

As an expert on the use of the Facebook API, I was invited to contribute to a major project in which behavioral data was surveyed via Facebook. Here is all the information related with this project: [The COVID-19 Health Behavior Survey](https://www.demogr.mpg.de/en/research_6120/digital_and_computational_demography_5555/social_and_environmental_dynamics_6603/the_covid_19_health_behavior_survey_9829/details).
