I have seen so many webpages that contain useful codes and posts that I started to imagine myself doing the same. But I just did not know where to start or what to write.

Now that I am part of [CAnD3](https://www.mcgill.ca/cand3/about/what-cand3), I have felt more and more encouraged to share my work, my ideas, my self. Sometimes to evolve we need an external force.

I am creating this section in my webpage "Collections", after attending the CAnD3 session on ePortfolios. The aim is to share my work, my ideas, my self with you (yes, you my-webpage visitor).

Hope you find it useful in some way.
