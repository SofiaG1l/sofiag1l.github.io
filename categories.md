I have seen so many webpages that contain useful codes and posts that I started to imagine myself doing the same. I just did not know where to start or what to write. Now that I am part of [CAnD3](https://www.mcgill.ca/cand3/about/what-cand3), I have felt more and more encouraged to share my work, my ideas, my self with you (yes, you my-webpage visitor).

Hope you find it useful in some way, just how I have found useful to read other people's posts.
