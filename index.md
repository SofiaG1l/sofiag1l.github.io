       Actuarial and Computer Scientist studying demographic processes.

Hi! I am a PhD student at the [MPIDR](https://www.demogr.mpg.de/en/institute/staff_directory_1899/beatriz_sofa_gil_3775.htm), affiliated with the Faculty of Spatial Sciences of the University of Groningen. I am also part of the international schools: [IMPRS-PHDS](https://www.imprs-phds.mpg.de/) and [CanD3](https://www.mcgill.ca/cand3/). Previously, I studied actuarial science at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM), and I have a MSc in Computer Science from the Mathematical Research Center of Mexico (CIMAT).

In my work, I use data from Facebook and Twitter to study older people’s usage of communication technologies and migrants’ cultural integration, respectively. I combine techniques from computer science (e.g. machine learning and metaheuristics) with statistical methods (generalized linear models, survival analysis, bootstrapping). 

My interests are: computational social science, demography, natural language processing, and computer science. I love coding, looking for patterns, and visualizing data.
