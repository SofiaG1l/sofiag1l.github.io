       Actuarial and Computer Scientist studying social dynamics.

Hi! I am a Researcher, Research Engineer, and Lab Manager at the [Societal Analytics Lab](https://www.societal-analytics.nl/).

Currently, I am working on two main research projects: (1) Responsible use of Artificial Intelligence in government agencies, and (2) North vs. South climate change narratives.

The first project, Responsible use of Artificial Intelligence in government agencies, aims to study how public servants use Artificial Intelligence in their daily work. In which situations do they use it? In which do they not? And how do they take the results into consideration? Based on this knowledge, I am co-developing an intervention in the form of a board game. This board game will empower public servants to use Artificial Intelligence responsibly and critically. More information [here](https://vu.nl/nl/verhalen/sofia-gil-clavel-over-verantwoord-gebruik-van-ai?utm_source=linkedin&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=interview_sofia).

The second project, North vs. South climate change narratives, is a comparative analysis of climate change narratives in Western-European and Latin American countries. 

Previously, I was a researcher at [TU Delft](https://repository.tudelft.nl/person/Person_eb58b9d8-7464-4c82-b675-9306fbf4aa81) working on the [SC3 project](https://www.sc3.center/). 

I obtained my Ph.D. from the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research, Germany, and the University of Groningen, Netherlands ([link](http://hdl.handle.net/11370/9e6422f5-196b-4aef-ad2f-54da72771e30)). Before, I studied actuarial science at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM), and I have a M.Sc. in Computer Science from the Mathematical Research Center of Mexico (CIMAT). 

During my Ph.D., I was part of the international schools: 
* [IMPRS-PHDS](https://www.imprs-phds.mpg.de/), Germany.
* [CAnD3](https://www.mcgill.ca/cand3/our-people/fellows-2021-22), Canada.
